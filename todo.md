# Missions 

Perform following missions one by one.

## Mission 1: Apply DSPy - Completed✅

DSPy is very useful tool for agent programming as it has prompt optimization feature.
Our first target is make the current code base to use DSPy framework.
I add `eval_dspy.py`, a DSPy version of `eval.py`.

You can reference many DSPy examples `ref/dspy-lecture2`.

## Mission 2: Use SVG Turtle - Completed✅

Turtle is python default graphic drawing library. But it depends on user interface module. Remote running is not easy and error-prone. So insteadof `turtle` module, Adopt svg-turtle and save the result as an image file directly. You can lookup `test_svg_turtle.py`.
